### About this application

This is a single player application which simulates an a stock market envrionment. Designed as a simulator, the player beings with a certain amount of funds and immediately thrown into the wild west of stock trading. The investor will have to rely on their intuition and a side of luck to grow their investment to the moon. This game invites all the come and experience the thrill of growing your investment fund through strategic stock purchases and sales. Or wallow in dispair as you see slowly see your money consumed by economic turnmoil.

Unfortunetly, do to project limitations, *APIs are not allowed and thus this simulator in no way reflects the current market*. To address this shortcoming, I had to make all stock prices all fluctuate randomly, but overall, all the stocks can be considered bullish. 

### Who is this for?

This application is open to anyone to use. Feedback is always appreciated :). 

### Project motivation

This is a neat little project that I am doing mainly because most of the stock trading apps that I found online were all pretty terrible and either infested with ads or require you to pay for more premium features. So I am being the change that I want to see and making a game that is ad-free and contains all the so-called "premium" features without any cost.
